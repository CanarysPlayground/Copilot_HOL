## Letâ€™s see an example on your first suggestion

GitHub Copilot provides suggestions for numerous languages and a wide variety of frameworks, but works especially well for `Python`, `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `Ruby`, `Go`, `C#` and `C++`. The following samples are in `C#`, but other languages will work similarly.

1.	In your `Visual Studio`, lets create a sample-project and then create a new `C#` (*.cs) file.

2.	In the `C#` file, type the following function signature. GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest an entire function body in grayed text, as shown below. The exact suggestion may vary.

    ```
    int CalculateDaysBetweenDates(
    ```

4.	To accept a suggestion, press `Tab`. To reject all suggestions, press `Esc`.

## Making code suggestions from comments

GitHub Copilot will recommend the appropriate code to carry out your request if you use natural language to express anything you wish to do in a comment.

2.	To prompt GitHub Copilot to suggest an implementation in the yaml file, type the following lines.

    ```
    // workflow to create a build
    ```

### References
By default, Copilot Chat will reference the file that you have open or the code that you have selected. You can also use # followed by a file name, file name and line numbers, or solution to reference a specific file, lines, or solution. For example:

Reference a specific file: `Where are the tests in #MyFile.cs?`
Reference multiple files: `How are these files related #MyFile.cs #MyFile2.cs`
Reference specific lines in a file: `Explain this function #MyFile.cs: 66-72?`
Reference the current file: `Is there a delete method in this #solution`
